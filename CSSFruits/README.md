# Context

This is a website made with plain HTML / CSS and JavaScript (though I decided to use SASS for the css to try it).

I made this before most of the other projects at Technobel (before we started using frameworks for the frontend) but I am only uploading now because for some reason, i never uploaded it on github to show the world :p

It contains multiple exercises that I completed while at Technobel, at the thime, I thought it would be more fun to make some of the exercises we were given accessible on one website with one theme instead of making each one into a separate thing.

It wasn't in the scope of the exercises, but I did use Jquery just for the Navbar because it felt wrong to copy paste it on every page :) because of that, you will need a local http server to run it properly and avoid CORS issues, a simple way of doing that is using python 3 is running the following command at the root of the folder: 

```py -m http.server```

or (if you got python from the microsoft store)

```pyton -m http.server``` 

# Exercises gathered on this repo:

- A  simple Home page with some informations about fruits
- A "shop" with a basket, it was an exercise to teach us to make an interactive list and play with the DOM
- A game of Memory, when I finished it, I had some spare time so I decided to add a little twist to it with a timer and difficulties (it is not entirely responsive so you might have to zoom a little bit for the grid to be square if your screen resolution is higher that 1080p)
- A quizz, in french, about fruits
- A rudimentary login system to make use of the localstorage
