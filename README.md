## Projects

### CSSFruits

When we were learning HTML / CSS / JavaScript, we were given a few assignments to train ourselves on some concepts. Instead of creating a new project each time, I thought it would be fun to keep adding each one to a single website with a common theme.

This project includes the following:
- **Home**: We were given a layout that we had to reproduce.
- **Products**: An exercise about interacting with the DOM using JavaScript.
- **Memory**: A working memory game. At the time, it was my favorite part of this project. I had fun building it, so I added a few additional features like a timer that speeds up when you make wrong guesses.
- **Quiz**: A simple quiz about fruits.
- **Login (Connexion)**: A very simple login to learn about local and session storage.
- **Navbar**: The navbar wasn't actually part of any task we had to complete, but I needed something to easily access the different pages. I used jQuery so I wouldn’t have to copy and paste it on every page.

Since this project uses jQuery, it cannot be viewed by simply opening the HTML files in your browser. It needs to be served by a server like "live-server" on NPM or something like Python's HTTP server. It is also hosted on my homelab at https://cssfruits.thomasc.ovh/ for easy access.

### Pokedex

A very simple Angular project to learn about Angular and how to interact with external APIs.

It can be accessed at https://pokedex.thomasc.ovh/. I thought about making it prettier, but I decided to keep it as is for history's sake :)

### EvenManager

A more complex Angular project to interact with an API. You could create events, visualize upcoming events, personal events, and more. It featured a functional login with permissions, interceptors, and a bunch of other concepts that we had the opportunity to learn.

Sadly, I no longer have access to the backend, so even though the frontend still works, all API calls are broken.

### Heroes VS Monsters

A C# console game that we were given as an assignment. We were given the rules and gameplay of the game and had to apply a bunch of object-oriented and C# concepts we learned, such as Enumerations, Interfaces, Models, Observables, and more, to implement it.

### Panoramix

Probably the most complex Angular project I made during the course. We had two weeks to build it as a team of three on the frontend and collaborated with another team who developed the backend based on how the project evolved. It is a data visualization tool where you could import CSV files and visually link them together, mark them as primary keys or not. You could then automatically create different types of graphs, create views and reports, and finally share and manage them with other users on the site.

Once again, I no longer have access to the backend, so all API calls won't reach anything.

### Hangman

This is a simple console Hangman game made in Python while we were learning the basics of programming.
